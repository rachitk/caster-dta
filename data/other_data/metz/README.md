Downloaded Metz from:

https://github.com/simonfqy/PADME/tree/master/metz_data

Specifically just need:

- Metz_interaction.csv (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonfqy/PADME/refs/heads/master/metz_data/Metz_interaction.csv)
    - this appears to be a copy of the interaction data in supplementary from the Metz et al. paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.530)
- prot_info.csv (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonfqy/PADME/refs/heads/master/metz_data/prot_info.csv)
